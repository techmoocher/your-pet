## Features

This application combines a dynamic virtual pet with a modern music player, all controlled from a convenient system tray icon.

### ðŸ¦Š The Interactive Fox Pet

The fox is designed with a variety of behaviors to feel like a true companion.

* **Personalized Onboarding:** Greets you according to the time of day and asks how you're feeling. It offers a supportive message based on your mood.
* **Autonomous Behavior:** The fox has a rich lifecycle to make it feel alive. It follows a walk-and-sleep cycle and will randomly:
    * **Pause** to look around.
    * **Wag** its tail happily.
    * **Wonder** which direction to go, thoughtfully turning its head.
* **User Interaction:**
    * **Drag and Drop:** You can pick up the fox and move it anywhere on your screen.
    * **Realistic Reactions:** The fox shows a "shocked" face while being dragged and takes a moment to recover with a "post-trauma" animation after you let it go.
    * **Gentle Pausing:** Clicking and holding the fox without moving it will simply cause it to pause its current action until you release.

### ðŸŽµ The Integrated Music Player

A beautiful and modern music player that runs in the background, fully controllable from the system tray.

* **Sleek, Frameless UI:** A clean, draggable window with a custom dark theme, rounded corners, and a glowing play button.
* **Full Playback Controls:** Features play/pause, next/previous, a draggable progress bar with a dynamic time display (`1:23 / 3:45`), and a volume slider.
* **Playback Modes:** Cycle between **Loop All**, **Loop One**, and **Shuffle** modes using your custom icons.
* **Background Play & Session Saving:** Close the window and the music keeps playing. The app saves your last played song, progress, volume, and playback mode to a `config.json` file, restoring your session on the next launch.
* **System Tray Sub-Menu:** Control your music (play/pause, skip, change loop mode, mute) directly from the tray icon without ever opening the player window.

## How to Use

### Adding Music

For the music player to find your songs, you must follow this folder structure:

1.  Create a folder named `music` in the same directory as `main.py`.
2.  Inside `music`, create a separate folder for each song. The folder name should be the **song's title** (e.g., `Interstellar-Main-Theme`).
3.  Inside each song folder, place the MP3 file and a thumbnail image.
    * The MP3 file must be named in the format: `Song-Title_Artist-Name.mp3`.
    * The thumbnail must be named: `thumbnail.jpg` (or `.png`, `.jfif`).

**Example Structure:**
```
your-pet/
â”œâ”€â”€ music/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Interstellar-Main-Theme/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Interstellar-Main-Theme_Hans-Zimmer.mp3
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ thumbnail.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (all the image assets)
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

### Interacting with the Pet

* **Click and drag** the fox to move it.
* **Click and hold** without moving to pause it.
* Use the **system tray icon** to hide/show the fox, control your music, or exit the application.
